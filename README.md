### Record your life in one short video a day

## How does it work?
- Each day you can record one short video - a snippet of your day. Don't miss your chance! 🎥
- Hop back in time or scroll through the calendar to see what your past self was up to 🎞️
- At any point export your diary to a single video, for a full recap of your life so far! 🎬

- Highly configurable, choose your own:
